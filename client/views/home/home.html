  {{#content classess="home-content"}}
    <p>This is the homepage here should a user be able to login. When he's logged in he should be able to select the team on which he has access to.
    For the time being every member has access to every team which means that a logged in user should see all the teams here. The <a href="{{pathFor 'teamHome' team="public" }}">public team</a>  gets created by default</p>

    <p>If you have ever started an older version of SpaceTalk please clear you database first after that you can login with admin/admin.</p>

    {{> atForm state='signIn'}}
    Once you log in, you will automatically be redirected to the backend interface.
