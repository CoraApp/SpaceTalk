SpaceTalk is an open-source chat app built with Meteor.

Note: SpaceTalk is beta software. Most of it should work but it's still a little unpolished and you'll probably find some bugs. Use at your own risk :)

### We Need Your Help!

A lot of work has already gone into SpaceTalk, but it needs that final push to reach its full potential.

So if you'd like to be part of the project, please check out the [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/R9Nh1V3t/spacetalk-roadmap) and [issues](https://github.com/SpaceTalk/SpaceTalk/issues) to see if there's anything you can help with. (Note: We're following [Meteor Style Guide](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Style-Guide))

### Prerequisites

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)

### Getting started

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:SpaceTalk/SpaceTalk.git
```

Start the app:

### Disclaimer

This code was part of a [Meteor Workshop](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-Goteborg/events/221282857/) that took place on the 14th of May 2015 in Gothenburg, Sweden.

We used it to build a chat application in 25 steps (https://slides.com/timbrandin/meteor-slack) – it was originally designed to look a little bit like Slack.

But it was solely made do demonstrate the efficiency and simple nature of Meteor applications.
