# SpaceTalk

A chat application made in 25 steps (https://slides.com/timbrandin/meteor-slack), originally designed to look a little bit like Slack.

> With channels for multiple users, markdown, gravatar, an autosizing textarea and a list of channels in a sidebar.

## Prerequisites

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)

## Getting started

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:SpaceTalk/SpaceTalk.git
```

Start the app:

```
cd SpaceTalk
meteor
```

## Disclaimer

This code is part of the Meteor Workshop that takes place on the 14th of May 2015 in Gothenburg Sweden.

It was made solely do demonstrate the efficiency and the simple nature of Meteor.

Now we're building an open source chat application out of this.
